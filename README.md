# Directed Force Graph

Using d3 and React to create a directed force graph. 

Interesting features:
  - all forces being used (center force removed in the end)
  - use of radial force
  - using viewBox svg attribute to center the nodes instead of a cenering force (MUCH BETTER!)

Also used the ResizeObserver API to efficiently update on resize events.
